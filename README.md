AIM: To study and implement  C++ bitwise operators. <br>

THEORY: <br>
Bitwise Operators <br>
These operators are used to perform bit-level operations: <br>

i)  & : Bitwise AND -> Performs a logical AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits of two operands. <br>
ii)  | : Bitwise OR -> Performs a logical OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits of two operands. <br>
iii)  ^ : Bitwise XOR -> Performs a logical XOR operation on each pair of corresponding bits of two operands. <br>
iv)  ~ : Bitwise NOT -> Bits of the operand are inverted. <br>
v)  << : Left shift -> Shifts the bits of the operand to the left by a specified number of positions.<br>
vi)  >> : Right shift-> Shifts the bits of the operand to the right by a specified number of positions. <br>

CONCLUSION : <br>
C++ bitwise operators are strong tools that allows you to deal with individual bits in data types. Low-level programming activities like hardware interface and some algorithm optimizations require them.
